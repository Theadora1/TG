		As rent rose in Williamsburg to match prices in Manhattan, restaurateurs pushed eastward, and they've spent the last several years colonizing Bushwick with unique offerings that run the gamut from vegan Ethiopian fare to Cuban sandwiches. Those businesses join a slew of already-established places, including a pocket of Mexican restaurants that outshines much of what's available in the rest of the city. The neighborhood is now home to dozens of destination-worthy eating establishments, and more open each week. A few, though, rise to the very top, serving as beacons that draw neighborhood regulars and culinary tourists. Here are the 10 best restaurants in Bushwick.

		<b>10. Northeast Kingdom, 18 Wyckoff Avenue, 718-386-3864</b>
		Northeast Kingdom doesn't always manage brilliant execution -- and we've had some dishes here that are full-on misses. But when this Vermont-themed restaurant hits, it really hits, and it manages to make local, seasonal produce and home-style cooking seem like a rare, otherworldly commodity. We tend to favor the simplest dishes on this constantly changing menu -- we once had an egg yolk-enhanced porridge here that was fully mind-melting -- though the burger is a safe bet if nothing's grabbing your eye. The succulent beef comes swaddled in cheddar and swiped with bacon mayo.

		<b>9. Roberta's, 261 Moore Street, 718-417-1118</b>
		Erected when Bushwick was more or less a culinary no-man's-land, Roberta's has enjoyed years of being the main reason Manhattanites venture out to east Williamsburg. You're not going to not have pizza here, and we won't begrudge you your blistered pies, topped with traditional mozzarella and tangy marinara or non-traditional corn and labne. But don't skip the rest of the menu: Start with creamy stracciatella and grilled bread, then order a salad or two -- each is a deftly crafted celebration of whatever's in season. Brunch dishes -- like cornmeal pancakes and various takes on hash -- are also worth a special trip. And though a wait here is inevitable, it's made bearable by the backyard bar, where you can order beer and frozen drinks in kiddie clubhouse-like digs.
